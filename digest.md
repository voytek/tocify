# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-16)

Prioritizing papers related to neural time series, oscillations, and cross-species electrophysiology. Many entries related to clinical aspects or non-neural-focused studies were deprioritized. This week's selection prioritizes advancements in neural signal processing and data science applications related to neural timescales and electrophysiology. No highly relevant papers in this week's listings. All items are heavily down-weighted due to mismatch with core interests, such as methods in neural time-series, oscillations, and cross-species electrophysiology. Papers were triaged based on neural dynamics, physiological signal processing, and computational approaches. For this week, none of the papers specifically matched the prioritized interests on neural time series methods, oscillations, or spectral analysis, leading to all items being downweighted significantly.

**Included:** 4 (score ≥ 0.35)

The predictive coding framework offers a compelling model for temporal signal processing in the cortex. Recent studies explored its implementation in spiking architectures using Hebbian plasticity rules or offline learning; however, a biologically inspired model that enables gradient-based minimization of prediction errors remains an open challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that the predictive coding objective can be optimized using the online and local nature of the e-prop learning algorith…

By definition, episodic memory is a conscious phenomenon. Memory traces reactivated by the hippocampus and reinstated in the sensory cortices need to enter conscious awareness for them to be re-experienced and overtly recalled. However, it remains unclear whether such reactivation in-and-of-itself ensures that memories will be overtly recalled. To investigate this, magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were analysed from thirty-one participants (18 female, 13 male) completing a video-word pair…
